## **Business Understanding**

**Marketing Problem:**

Customers and businesses are facing a significant marketing challenge: the vast amount of reviews left on Google Maps makes it difficult to efficiently analyze and understand customer sentiment. This lack of insight hinders businesses from effectively gauging customer satisfaction with their products, services, and overall experience. Manually sifting through large numbers of reviews is time-consuming and cumbersome, making it hard to identify trends, prioritize areas for improvement, or measure the impact of marketing campaigns. As a result, valuable customer feedback might go unnoticed, leading to missed opportunities for improvement and potentially negative customer experiences. Businesses might also struggle to respond promptly to negative reviews or invest resources in addressing issues that are not the primary drivers of customer dissatisfaction. Overall, the lack of efficient customer sentiment analysis within Google Maps reviews creates a barrier to understanding customer perception, hindering businesses from making data-driven decisions and achieving long-term success.

*   Enhance customer relationship management by gaining deeper insights into customer experiences and feedback.
